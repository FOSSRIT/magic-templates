Today, FOSS@MAGIC sponsors numerous projects, hackathons, regional get-togethers, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and events throughout the year in connection with the MAGIC Center, the School of Interactive Games &amp; Media, the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing &amp; Information Sciences, and other elements of the campus that span the entire university, as well as numerous external partners. <a href="history.html">Since 2009</a>, this group has brought FOSS speakers to campus, sponsored professional development opportunities for faculty, housed externally sponsored and faculty and student created research and development projects and has brought an annual regional FOSS conference to the RIT campus on several occasions. Known throughout the region, this group is an active and vibrant part of the Rochester open source movement, and is engaged with a variety of institutions throughout the region and the nation.  
<br/><br/>
Specifically, FOSS @ RIT is an initiative to promote Free/Open Source Software related activities at RIT that:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li class="site_text">Pursues applied research in and around RIT and with sponsors and external entities</li>
<li class="site_text">Supports Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships</li>
<li class="site_text">Develops and/or supports FOSS academic efforts including the Open Source Minor, project courses and independent studies</li>
<li class="site_text">Coordinates and/or sponsors FOSS events like hackathons, speakers and POSSE</li>
<li class="site_text">Offers students employment opportunities for part-time work and co-ops with projects that are released via open-source license</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>The initiative <a href="history.html">grew out of</a> the <a href="http://igm.rit.edu" target="top">School of Interactive Games and Media</a>'s first seminar in educational game development for the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) in 2008.

<h4>Key Programs and Departments Engaged in FOSS @ MAGIC</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="site_text"><b><a href="http://igm.rit.edu" target="top">School of Interactive Games &amp; Media</a></b>, Golisano College of Computing &amp; Information Sciences: The School of IGM is home to several courses and projects, as well as the <a href="minor.html">Minor in Open Source and Free Culture</a>, the first of its kind at any academic institution in the world.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Background and Need for Research</h4>
<p>Support for Open Source methodologies and practices is in its early stages in higher education. Computing programs around the world use tools, develop code libraries, and share their work with others, but often publish in ways that are restrictive, non-collaborative or less 'open' than they might appear. Traditional academic publishing is a closed, and in some cases predatory, practice. The current commercial sector is dominated by players that produce closed-source solutions, but this is rapidly changing; with several major corporations now producing libraries and toolsets available through Open Source licenses. Open Source is now a growing strategic component of the software world, but that is only scratching the surface. While the methodologies and practices of the FOSS movement often seem a good match to the ethos of the university, <b>we feel universities must go further and provide direct educational and experiential opportunities for students to learn about Open Source processes and practices</b>. Only by directly engaging in work with these tools, practices, and communities will students effectively incorporate the benefits of the Open Source approach in their own work and contributions.<br/><br/> 

Our work is humanitarian in focus and is generously supported by Red Hat and by Fedora (who donated the original 25 XO laptops that started us off for RIT's first FOSS class.) OLPC, Sugar Labs, and others have donated hardware and/or sponsored co-ops and Hackathons. Our funding is used largely to support Open Source student projects, library contributions, and development opportunities. In addition, such funding supports hackathons, outreach and engagement events with the local community and regional and national institutions. Our work engages students, faculty, and staff in exploring the possibilities as software becomes a freely available resource, both to draw from and contribute to. We're solving the world's problems through code.

            <h4>Mathmematical Adventure: Fortune Hunter</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>Mathematical Adventure: Fortune Hunter draws on teaching children of a global scale fourth grade mathematics through the guise of a dungeon styled adventure game. Players will be able to explore dungeons and fight fearsome battles with various monsters, each pertaining to a unique mathematical concept. The player controls a protagonist that must progress through maze-like dungeons, solve puzzles / problems, and defeat enemies in a two dimensional world. It is a single player adventure with room for ad hoc cooperative play in the future.  Submitted by: jlew.<br/><br/>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b>One day workshop for Girl Scouts of America
            (GSA) troop members to complete their “Games for Life Interest
            Project” (GFL). Scouts are provided with thumb drives with all the
            necessary files for the tutorials on them as well as installers and
            run-time versions of Scratch. The workshop has been offered, in
            various forms, four times in Rochester, New York and once in Los
            Angeles, California. Materials for the various workshops were
            created and/or revised by Stephen Jacobs, Kelly Piering, Sela
            Davis, Heather Arbiter, Joe Pietruch, Yana Malysheva and Justin
            Lewis. All Rochester workshops have been coordinated by Amy Carey
            of AWC and Digital Rochester.</p><br/><br/>

            <h4>Open Video Chat</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Open Video Chat is a Video Chat Activity for the XO Platform.  Developers sponsored by PEN International were tasked with developing a proof of concept by improving the underlying software stack to improve video chat accessibility for communication between deaf and hard of hearing students in a classroom environment. The project leaders at PEN have expressed a long-term interest in the life of this application that includes release into the Opensource ecosystem, and eventually porting to other platforms.<br/><br/>Team members for the project include Stephen Jacobs (RIT Faculty Advisor), 
Remy DeCausemaker (RIT Project Lead - Storytelling, Evaluations, Mentor), 
Justin Lewis    (RIT Dev Team - Lead),
Taylor Rose Blog (Dev Team - Developer),
Fran Rogers RIT  (Dev Team - Developer),

            <h4>Wikiotics</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Wikiotics is a community site for collaborative language instruction. The site aims to provide easy tools for teachers and students to create high quality language lessons that are immersion focused, interactive, and easy to share. These activities are supported by the Wikiotics Foundation, an independent 501(c)3 non-profit. Starting in September 2010 two RIT students, Nate Case and Taylor Rose began contributing to the project through the FOSS@RIT movement.  Submitted by: trose.<br/><br/>

            <h4>Blocku</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>Blocku is a puzzle game consisting of filling a grid with squares by matching the squares sides by following a constraint. Blocku is a game that can be used by teachers to teach a multitude of subjects to students. The teacher will be able to create a constraint such as match the formula to the answer or A + B = C. Then the teacher makes a list with two columns. Each row in the columns is a pair of of matching objects. The first row of column A matches the first row of column B. Using this formula the game will randomly assign the objects of each column to square blocks, one object per side. The student then has to put all the pieces in a grid so that pairs on the sides of the squares follow the constraint. The student will be able to move the pieces as well as rotate them.

It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. All attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who can't be present. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join.
