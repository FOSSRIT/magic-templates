            <h4>FOSS @ MAGIC</h4>
            <p>One of the most unique initiatives at MAGIC is the FOSS@MAGIC effort, an initiative that originally grew out of the Department of Interactive Games and Media's course in educational game development for the OLPC. </p>
            <p>Today, FOSS@MAGIC sponsors numerous projects, hackathons, regional get-togethers, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and events throughout the year in connection with the MAGIC Center, the School of IGM, the Golisano College of Computing &amp; Information Sciences, other elements of the campus that span the entire university, and external partners.</p>
            <p>Since 2009, this group has brought FOSS speakers to campus, sponsored professional development opportunities for faculty, housed externally sponsored and faculty and student created research and development projects and has brought an annual regional FOSS conference to the RIT campus on several occasions. Known throughout the region, this group is an active and vibrant part of the Rochester open source movement, and is engaged with a variety of institutions throughout the region and the nation.</p>
            <p>Specifically, FOSS @ RIT is an initiative to promote Free/Open Source Software related activities at RIT that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="site_text">Pursues applied research in and around RIT and with sponsors and external entities</li>

            <h4>Key Programs and Departments Engaged in FOSS @ MAGIC</h4>
            <ul>
              <li class="site_text"><b>School of Interactive Games &amp; Media</b>, Golisano College of Computing &amp; Information Sciences: The School of IGM is home to several courses and projects, as well as the <b>Open Source Minor</b>, the first of its kind at any academic institution in the world.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Background and Need for Research</h4>
            <p>Support for open source methodologies and practices is often haphazard or an afterthought in higher education.  Computing programs around the world use tools, develop code libraries, and share their work with others, but often publish in ways that are restrictive or less 'open' than they might appear.  The current commercial sector is dominated by players that produce closed-source solutions, but this is rapidly changing, with several major corporations now producing libraries and toolsets available through open source licenses.</p>
            <p>Open source is now a key strategic component of the software world, but that is only scratching the surface: while the methodologies and practices of the FOSS movement often seem a good match to the ethos of the university, <b>we feel universities must go further and provide direct educational and experiential opportunities for students to learn about open source processes and practices</b>.  Only by directly engaging in work with these tools, practices, and communities will students effectively incorporate the benefits of the open source approach in their own work and contributions.</p>
            <p>Our work is generously funded by Red Hat, Sugar Labs, and others, with such funding used largely to support open source student porjects, library contributions, and development opportunities.</p>
            <p>In addition, such funding supports curriculum development, hack-a-thons, outreach and engagement events with the local community and regional and national institutions.  Our work engages students, faculty, and staff in exploring the possibilities that become possible as software becomes a freely available resource, both to draw from and contribute to.  We're solving the worlds problems through code.</p>

                <h5 class="abstract">Abstract</h5>
                <p>Blocku is a puzzle game consisting of filling a grid with squares by matching the squares sides by following a constraint. </p>
                <p>Blocku is a game that can be used by teachers to teach a multitude of subjects to students. The teacher will be able to create a constraint such as match the formula to the answer or A + B = C. Then the teacher makes a list with two columns. Each row in the columns is a pair of of matching objects. The first row of column A matches the first row of column B.</p>
                <p>Using this formula the game will randomly assign the objects of each column to square blocks, one object per side. The student then has to put all the pieces in a grid so that pairs on the sides of the squares follow the constraint. The student will be able to move the pieces as well as rotate them.

                <p>The goal of this project has been to research and plan a game which promotes and rewards FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) development. However, this goal is no easy task since game design alone provides intense challenges to providing a fun and balanced experience. Adding on FOSS development stats makes game design much harder, adding imbalance and other issues. On top of all of this, we have been going in alone, researching this new topic that has little prior research.</p>

                <h4 class="project-title">Girl Scouts games for Life Workshop</h4>
                <h5 class="abstract">Abstract</h5>
                <p>Since March, 2009, RIT’s Lab for Technological Literacy and faculty and students from the Game Design and Development degree programs currently housed in the School of Interactive Games and Media have led a one day workshop for Girl Scouts of America (GSA) troop members to complete their “Games for Life Interest Project.” (GFL) The workshop has been offered, in various forms, four times in Rochester, New York and once in Los Angeles, California.</p>
                <p>These materials have now been refined to the point where they can be released so that other Girl Scout Troops across the country can offer the workshop in their home communities. They can also be used for a general introduction to game design and development outside of the Girl Scouts. The current versions of the interactive tutorials are in Scratch, a multi-platform, open source tool that can be installed on Windows, Apple or Linux operating systems.</p>
                <h5>Workshop Organization</h5>
                <p>The workshop begins with an introduction to the components of a game (i.e. it’s Formal Elements). The slide show attached discusses the roles of players, different types of game mechanics, win conditions, and other game components using examples of common board games to keep the concepts clear.  Next the scouts play some “casual” web games of different types, read reviews of those games from web sites, and discuss them in terms of the formal elements they just learned about. Games we have used are The Company of Myself, Red Remover and Learn To Fly.  After the play session, usually during lunch, the girls hear presentations from one or more professionals in the field about careers in the game industry.  After lunch the Scouts spend some time working on tutorials on building games in Scratch. They are provided with thumb drives with all the necessary files for the tutorials on them as well as installers and run-time versions of Scratch.</p><img src="projects/gs_games_montage.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <p>It takes a village to give a workshop, and the group that has supported the workshop over the years is a sizeable one. Professor Jim Leone, Department Chair of RIT’s Department of Information Technology, sponsored the original workshop materials development in 2008. Microsoft Research funded the second round of materials development. The final round of materials development was sponsored by RIT’s Lab for Technological Literacy. RIT and The Rochester Association of Women in Computing sponsored Rochester workshop events. Our Rochester GSA coordinator was Laura Robinson, Program Manager, Girl Scouts of Western New York. The SIGGRAPH Los Angeles workshop was sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, Autodesk, Inc, and Intel Inc. Our GSA Co-Coordinator was Katherine Poulin-Kerstien, STEM Program Specialist, Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles. Materials for the various workshops were created and/or revised by Stephen Jacobs, Kelly Piering, Sela Davis, Heather Arbiter, Joe Pietruch, Yana Malysheva and Justin Lewis. All Rochester workshops have been coordinated by Amy Carey of AWC and Digital Rochester.</p>

                <h5 class="abstract">Abstract</h5>
                <p>MediaWiki Visualization is a python program that watches a wiki for changes using the MediaWiki API. It loads up a list of pages and their link structures and then watches the change log. When a page is changed it links the user to the page as well as linking to any pages it links to.</p>
                <p>The visualization is currently using <a href="http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/" target="top">ubigraph</a> to draw the visualization with the help of the networkx python module. It also uses the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/" target="top">twisted framework</a> to pull the api at a configurable interval.  Submitted by: jlew.</p>
