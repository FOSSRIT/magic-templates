    <h4><a href="http://barcamproc.org" target="top">BarcampROC</a></h4>
    <p>In the spirit of FooCamp, BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. All attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who can't be present. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join. Venture over to the BarcampRochester tag on Flickr for photos from the previous three events!</p>
