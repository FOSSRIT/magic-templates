<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>OLPC was the Trojan Horse to Open Source for Professor Stephen Jacobs,
director of RIT’s Lab for Technological Literacy (LTL), the entity in
which the <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#70;&#x4f;&#x53;&#83;&#64;&#77;&#x41;&#x47;&#x49;&#x43;">&#70;&#x4f;&#x53;&#83;&#64;&#77;&#x41;&#x47;&#x49;&#x43;</a> (then <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#70;&#x4f;&#83;&#83;&#64;&#82;&#73;&#84;">&#70;&#x4f;&#83;&#83;&#64;&#82;&#73;&#84;</a>) was originally born. Intrigued
by the OLPC Jacobs acquired three OLPC XO 1.0 laptops in 2007 via the
first &quot;Give One, Get One&quot; program. His intent was to make them available
to students for experimentation and to possibly create a seminar course
in developing games for the platform.</p>
<p>The LTL also ran a campus OLPC Users Group with then lab associate <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=4819406&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=sZFm&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=42971393765003805&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=35&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId:42971393765003805,VSRPtargetId:4819406,VSRPcmpt:primary">Eric
Grace</a>
from January to June 2008. <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/User:FGrose">Frederick
Grose</a>, an active OLPC community
volunteer, joined the LTL campus users group meetings and worked with an
<a href="http://lists.laptop.org/pipermail/devel/2008-March/011806.html">RIT usability
class</a>
to assess OLPC usability in 2008. He also made a generous donation to
the lab to fund some early OLPC work.</p>
<p>The first OLPC seminar course was scheduled for the spring quarter of
the 2008-2009 academic year through the RIT Honor’s program. To support
the class, Jacobs and Grace decided to create a community wide <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Rochester,_NY">users’
group</a> in January 2009
around the OLPC to support the class. Key members of the group were
Grace, Grose and <a href="http://karlierobinson.com/about-me">Karlie Robinson</a>,
an entrepreneur who runs the Open Source distribution site
<a href="http://www.ondisk.com/">OnDisk.com</a>.</p>
<p>Robinson, a long-time Open Source advocate, connected the class to Sugar
Labs’ Math 4 initiative and David Nalley in the Fedora Community, which
donated 25 XO laptops to Jacobs for use in Sugar development in general,
and Math software and games to support 4th grade curricula in specific.</p>
<p>The course was offered in March 2009, with Jacobs and Grace co-teaching
and developing the materials and Grose and Robinson as FOSS community
representatives who visited the class regularly; roles they reprised in
the next two iterations of the course. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=9229957&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=lqTB&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=42971393765668394&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=13&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId:42971393765668394,VSRPtargetId:9229957,VSRPcmpt:primary">Mel
Chua</a>(then
Community Engineer for Red Hat), guest lectured for us, beginning a long
relationship with RIT&#39;s FOSS folk. The class also attended regular user
group meetings to meet with community members and discuss projects and
techniques. <a href="http://activitycentral.com/company/people">David Farning</a>
dropped by RIT during the summer to meet with us. After the first course
we moved to RIT&#39;s Student Innovation Hall.</p>
<p>With the second iteration of the seminar course Red Hat paid their first
official visit by sending <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gregdek">Greg
DeKoenigsberg</a> (then Senior
Community Architect for Red Hat), Mel, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemacken">Luke
Macken</a> (an RIT alum) and
Macken&#39;s former college roommate, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/decause">Remy
Decausemaker</a>, who tagged along for
the visit. In Winter Quarter, 2009, Remy DeCausemaker, RIT alum, joined
RIT as an Alumni Fellow. In February of 2010 <a href="http://foss.rit.edu/audio/play/56">Richard
Stallman</a> came to speak and <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6561388">Walter
Bender</a> paid us the first of his
two visits that May. That Spring we paid our <a href="http://opensource.com/education/10/7/olpc-and-fossrit-education-innovation-open-source-way">first visit to
Boston</a>
to visit OLPC and Red Hat&#39;s Westford offices.</p>
<p>But what was most important in the academic year of 2009-2010 was that
the second offering of the seminar is what began the true heart of our
program. One of the games developed in the course was Fortune Hunter. At
the end of the Winter quarter course members of the team asked to have a
co-op created for them to continue working on it. These students who
were pursuing their co-op in Spring of 2010 also came to the third class
offering, on their own time, to mentor students and recruit them to join
Fortune Hunter. Thus began what we call the <a href="http://opensource.com/education/10/3/course-co-op-lifecycle-openinnovationrit">“Course to Co-Op
Lifecycle”</a>;
students who become proficient in Open Source through our classes then
become eligible for part-time or co-op work when opportunities become
available. That summer we offered the first of three
<a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a> sessions we would
run in &#39;10, &#39;11 and &#39;12.</p>
<p>In August of 2010 we began talking with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/spotrh">Tom
Callaway</a> of Red Hat, (then Fedora
Engineering Manager, now University Outreach and Fedora Special
Projects) about formal sponsorship from Red Hat for our program. Through
his hard work and the generosity of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=343346&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=_BvK&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=42971393768195908&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=1&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId:42971393768195908,VSRPtargetId:343346,VSRPcmpt:primary">Brian
Stevens</a>,
<a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#x46;&#79;&#83;&#83;&#64;&#x4d;&#65;&#x47;&#x49;&#x43;">&#x46;&#79;&#83;&#83;&#64;&#x4d;&#65;&#x47;&#x49;&#x43;</a> has been sponsored by Red Hat since 2011, allowing RIT to
hire Remy full-time as our Lab Director and FOSS evangelist. (though he
prefers to be known as our Open Sourcer). We added a second course,
Project in FOSS Development in 2011 and will be offering the first
interdisciplinary <a href="http://magic.rit.edu/fiss/minor">minor</a> in Free and
Open Source Software and Free Culture in Fall of 2014.</p>
<p>Along the way we&#39;ve done a few things including...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>50+ hackathons regional get-togethers, birds-of-a-feather gatherings
and internationally renowned speakers such as Richard Stallman, Hal
Abelson and Walter Bender</p>
</li>
<li><p>Professional development opportunities for faculty, staff and
graduate students including three annual week-long instances of
<a href="http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/POSSE">POSSE</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Outreach to other Colleges and Universities, K-12 schools and
community organizations like <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HackshackersROC/">Hacks/Hackers
Rochester</a> and the <a href="http://opensource.com/education/11/5/games-life-girl-scouts-games-and-open-source-way">Girl
Scouts</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>30+ Undergraduate Research Fellowships, Co-Ops and part-time student
positions doing humanitarian project work including nation-building
work with UNICEF’s Innovation Lab in Kosovo and Educational Games
for OLPC and Sugar Labs downloaded around the world and honored at
the White House.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applied research projects for RIT, Red Hat, Mozilla Open Badges,
OLPC and Sugar Labs</p>

    <p>In the spirit of FooCamp, BarCamp is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. All attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who can't be present. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join. Venture over to the BarcampRochester tag on Flickr for photos from the previous three events!</p>
